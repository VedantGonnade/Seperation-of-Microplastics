# Seperation-of-Microplastics
In this project, a CMOS camera was used to take images of ploymers and natural materials after exciting them with a laser or a UV-LED. Photoluminescence of these material was filtered by using different bandpass filters and images were taken and it was analyzed to build a robust diffrentiation method. It was coded using Python modules. 

This repository consists of various files to do different tasks with images. 
Image analysis code can be found in the folder named "microplastics" and code to operate the camera is uploaded outdide the folder.
